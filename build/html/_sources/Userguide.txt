On a monthly basis, the Malaria Control Unit, drug management committee meets to review the stock status ofmalaria commodities in the country, by analyzing data from various sources including:
	#. Facility and County Level Stock Data from DHIS.
	#. National Level Stock Status data from the Supply Chain Agencies (Central SOH).
	#. Pipeline information based on pending shipments per funding agency.

This data is aggregated and analyzed for the different malaria commodities and a 2 pager report generated that
indicates to management, the months stock status and pipeline monitoring of Malaria commodities.
